# Endpoints

In the **REST API Template**, all endpoints are defined inside `src/routes`, and each route connects to a matching controller in `src/controllers`.

This structure makes it easy to expand your API without cluttering your main app file.

---

## Folder Overview

```

src/
├── routes/
│   ├── user.route.js
│   └── health.route.js
└── controllers/
└── user.controller.js

````

- **Routes** define the HTTP endpoints (`GET /users`, `POST /users`, etc.)
- **Controllers** hold the logic that runs when those endpoints are called

---

## Example Route File

`src/routes/posts.route.js`

```js
import express from "express"
import { createPost, getPosts } from "../controllers/posts.controller.js"

const router = express.Router()

router.get("/", getPosts)
router.post("/", createPost)

export default router
````

---

## Example Controller File

`src/controllers/posts.controller.js`

```js
import { ApiResponse } from "../utils/ApiResponse.js"

export const getPosts = (req, res) => {
  const posts = [
    { id: 1, title: "Hello World" },
    { id: 2, title: "NeatNode Rocks" }
  ]
  return ApiResponse.success(res, posts)
}

export const createPost = (req, res) => {
  const { title } = req.body
  return ApiResponse.success(res, { id: Date.now(), title })
}
```

---

## Route Registration

All route files are automatically registered inside `src/app.js` under the comment markers:

```js
// ROUTE_IMPORTS_START
import userRouter from "./routes/user.route.js"
// ROUTE_IMPORTS_END

// ROUTE_USES_START
app.use("/api/users", userRouter)
// ROUTE_USES_END
```

When the CLI removes CRUD examples, these sections are automatically stripped clean — keeping your app.js organized.

To add your own routes, simply add new imports between those markers or below them.

---

## Creating a New Resource

Example: Add a `products` resource.

1. Create your controller:
   `src/controllers/products.controller.js`
2. Add routes:
   `src/routes/products.route.js`
3. Import and register them in `src/app.js`:

   ```js
   import productRouter from "./routes/products.route.js"
   app.use("/api/products", productRouter)
   ```

That’s it — your new API endpoints are ready.

---

## CRUD Pattern

Each resource typically follows this pattern:

| Method   | Path             | Purpose         |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| `GET`    | `/api/items`     | Get all items   |
| `GET`    | `/api/items/:id` | Get single item |
| `POST`   | `/api/items`     | Create item     |
| `PUT`    | `/api/items/:id` | Update item     |
| `DELETE` | `/api/items/:id` | Delete item     |

---

## Notes

* Controllers should handle **business logic** and return formatted responses using `ApiResponse`.
* Avoid direct DB logic inside route files — always delegate to controllers or services.
* Group routes by resource for maintainability.

---

## Summary

| Folder         | Purpose                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `routes/`      | HTTP route definitions              |
| `controllers/` | Request handlers and response logic |
| `app.js`       | Central route registration point    |

This modular pattern keeps every endpoint predictable, testable, and easy to extend as your API grows.
