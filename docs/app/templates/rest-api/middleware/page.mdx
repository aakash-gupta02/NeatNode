# Middleware

The REST template centralizes middleware under `src/middleware`. Common middleware included or expected:

- `auth.middleware.js` — protects routes using JWT tokens.
- `validateRequest.middleware.js` — request validation (Joi) wrapper.
- `rateLimiter.js` — rate limiting for sensitive endpoints.
- `error.middleware.js` — centralized error handler.

Attach middleware globally in `src/app.js` or to individual routes as needed.
