# Events

The **Socket.IO Template** gives you full control over how real-time events are registered and managed.  
It doesn’t ship with many default events — instead, you define your own handlers under `src/events/` and wire them inside the socket initializer.

---

## Folder Layout

```

src/
├── config/
│   └── socket.js
└── events/
└── chat.js

````

- `config/socket.js` initializes Socket.IO  
- `events/` contains individual event handler modules  
- Each handler is imported and registered in the initializer  

---

## Example: Chat Event Handler

```js
// src/events/chat.js
export default function registerChat(io) {
  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log(`User connected: ${socket.id}`)

    socket.on("message", (data) => {
      console.log("Message received:", data)
      socket.broadcast.emit("message", data)
    })

    socket.on("disconnect", () => {
      console.log(`User disconnected: ${socket.id}`)
    })
  })
}
````

---

## Registering the Handler

In `src/config/socket.js`, import and register your event modules:

```js
import { Server } from "socket.io"
import registerChat from "../events/chat.js"

export const initSocket = (server) => {
  const io = new Server(server, { cors: { origin: "*" } })

  // Register all socket event handlers
  registerChat(io)

  return io
}
```

This modular approach keeps your socket logic clean, testable, and easy to scale — add one file per event group, and import them all into the socket initializer.

---

## Best Practices

* Group related events in the same file (e.g., `chat.js`, `notifications.js`)
* Always handle disconnect events to clean up listeners
* Keep socket logic lightweight — move heavy operations to services
* Use `socket.broadcast.emit()` carefully to avoid unnecessary network traffic

## Summary

| File               | Role                                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `config/socket.js` | Creates Socket.IO instance and loads event handlers |
| `events/chat.js`   | Example event registration module                   |
| `server.js`        | Passes HTTP server to `initSocket()`                |

Each event file is fully modular — just import it, register it, and start emitting.

This event structure makes NeatNode’s Socket template flexible, clean, and production-ready for any real-time application.
