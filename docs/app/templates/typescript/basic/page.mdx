# Basic Template

The **Basic Template (TS)** is a clean, minimal **Express + TypeScript** starter focused on clarity and type safety.  
It’s ideal for developers who want a working backend with TypeScript without unnecessary complexity.

---

## Overview

This template generates a fully functional **TypeScript-based Express server** in seconds.  
It’s suitable for:

- Developers learning Express with TypeScript  
- Quick prototypes with type safety  
- Lightweight services that don’t require advanced layers  

You get a typed `server.ts`, a configured Express app, and essential middleware prewired.  
No authentication, no complex services — just a clean, typed foundation.

## Folder Structure

```bash
<project-root>/
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
└─ src/
   ├─ app.ts
   ├─ server.ts
   ├─ config/
   │  └─ database.ts
   ├─ routes/
   │  └─ todo.route.ts
   ├─ controllers/
   │  └─ todo.controller.ts
   ├─ models/
   │  └─ todo.model.ts
````

## Features

* Preconfigured **Express server with TypeScript**
* Strict typing via **tsconfig**
* Built-in **CORS** and **JSON body parsing**
* Logging via **Morgan**
* Example **Todo CRUD** with typed controllers and models
* Clean and extendable structure

You can remove the example CRUD automatically by selecting **“No”** when the CLI prompts for CRUD.
NeatNode removes all related files for you.

## When to Use

Use the **Basic Template (TS)** when you want to:

* Learn Express with proper TypeScript patterns
* Build small services with type safety
* Prototype APIs without architectural overhead
* Keep everything simple and understandable

This template intentionally avoids advanced abstractions so you can scale it your way.

---

## Customization Ideas

* Add more routes under `src/routes/`
* Extend models with interfaces or types
* Introduce a `modules/` folder later if the project grows
* Plug in a database or ORM when needed

---

## Summary

The **Basic Template (TypeScript)** helps you:

* Start backend development with TypeScript the right way
* Understand Express flow with clear typing
* Build quickly without boilerplate overload
* Migrate smoothly to advanced NeatNode TS templates later

It’s a solid starting point for any TypeScript-based Node.js backend.
