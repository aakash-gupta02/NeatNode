# REST API Template

The **REST API Template** is a structured and production-ready Node.js setup.  
It extends the Basic Template with authentication, validation, service layers, and centralized error handling.

This is the template you'll use when building real-world APIs — scalable, testable, and maintainable from day one.

---

## Overview

It's designed for developers who want to:
- Skip repetitive boilerplate setup  
- Follow best practices for Express architecture  
- Implement CRUD operations cleanly  
- Use layered structure for routes, controllers, services, and models  

The template is already wired with everything you'd expect in a real backend — you just start coding your business logic.

> [!TIP]
> See the [Folder Structure Guide](/guides/folder-structure) for detailed project layouts.

## Key Features

- Modular Express setup with **controllers**, **services**, and **routes**
- Centralized error handling and custom response formatting
- Built-in **JWT authentication**
- Request **validation** using Joi
- Security via **Helmet** and **Rate Limiting**
- Structured logging with **Winston**
- Environment-ready `.env` support
- Optional CRUD removal (like Basic Template)

## How It Works

When you run:
```bash
npx neatnode
```

and select `REST API`, the CLI will:

1. Copy this full structure into your project folder
2. Replace placeholders (like project name)
3. Optionally remove CRUD examples (User routes, controllers, etc.)
4. Leave you with a ready-to-run production API base

* **Middleware** — Add or modify middleware for requests
* **Error Handling** — Understand the centralized error layer

## When to Use

Choose the **REST API Template** if you:

* Are building a real backend or web API
* Want clear separation of concerns
* Need built-in auth, validation, and structured error handling
* Prefer a scalable folder architecture out of the box

This is the go-to template for production-quality Node.js projects.
