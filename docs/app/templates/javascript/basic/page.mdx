# Basic Template

The **Basic Template** is a clean, minimal Node.js starter built for simplicity.  
It’s ideal for developers who want a working Express server without any unnecessary setup.

---

## Overview

This template gives you a fully functional backend in seconds.  
It’s perfect for:
- Beginners learning Express or backend fundamentals  
- Building quick prototypes and proof-of-concepts  
- Lightweight microservices that don’t need complex layers  

You get a single-entry `server.js` file, a configured Express app, and essential middleware prewired.  
No databases, no auth, no clutter — just a clean foundation to start coding.

> [!TIP]
> See the [Folder Structure Guide](/guides/folder-structure) for a detailed breakdown of the project layout.

## Features

- Preconfigured **Express server**
- Built-in **CORS** and **JSON body parsing**
- Logging via **Morgan**
- Simple CRUD example (Todo)
- Clean and extendable structure

You can remove the example CRUD automatically by selecting “No” when the CLI asks to include CRUD routes.  
This keeps the generated project minimal and focused.

---

## When to Use

Use the **Basic Template** when you want to:
- Understand Express routing and middleware flow
- Start small and scale later
- Create demos, test APIs, or internal tools
- Experiment with new libraries or API concepts

It’s intentionally simple — no authentication, no databases, and no heavy dependencies.  
You’re in full control of how to expand it.

---

## Customization Ideas

- Add your own routes under `src/routes/`
- Introduce a `config/` folder for environment-based settings
- Replace the `todo` example with your own modules
- Integrate a lightweight database like SQLite or MongoDB later

---

## Summary

The **Basic Template** helps you:
- Learn the backend fundamentals by seeing everything in one place  
- Prototype new ideas quickly without setup overhead  
- Transition smoothly into the **REST API** or **Socket.IO** templates once your project grows  

It’s the perfect starting point for beginners — simple enough to understand, flexible enough to expand.
