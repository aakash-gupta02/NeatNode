# Socket.IO Template

The **Socket.IO Template** gives you a ready-to-run real-time backend built on **Express** and **Socket.IO**.  
It's ideal for chat apps, live dashboards, notifications, or multiplayer systems where low-latency updates matter.

---

## Overview

This template extends the Basic Express setup to include real-time bidirectional communication.  
It automatically configures:
- A shared HTTP + Socket.IO server  
- Centralized socket initialization (`src/config/socket.js`)  
- A clean folder structure for organizing events and logic  
- Support for both REST routes and Socket events in one project

> [!TIP]
> See the [Folder Structure Guide](/guides/folder-structure) for detailed project layouts.

---

## Example Socket Initialization

```js
// src/config/socket.js
import { Server } from "socket.io"

export const initSocket = (server) => {
  const io = new Server(server, {
    cors: { origin: "*" }
  })

  io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log(`User connected: ${socket.id}`)
    socket.on("disconnect", () => console.log("User disconnected"))
  })

  return io
}
```

And in `server.js`:

```js
import http from "http"
import app from "./src/app.js"
import { initSocket } from "./src/config/socket.js"

const server = http.createServer(app)
initSocket(server)

server.listen(5000, () => console.log("Server running on port 5000"))
```

## When to Use

Use this template when your project requires:

* Real-time updates (chat, dashboards, notifications)
* Persistent user sessions via websockets
* Live collaboration features
* Seamless REST + Socket integration in one backend

This setup handles both HTTP and WebSocket traffic efficiently — ready to scale from prototype to production.
