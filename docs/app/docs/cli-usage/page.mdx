# CLI Usage

Run the CLI locally:

```bash
npx neatnode
```

Prompts and behavior:

1. Project name — default `my-app`. Use `.` to scaffold into the current directory.
2. Template selection — choose one of: Basic Express, REST API, or Socket.IO Setup.
3. Include example CRUD — for Basic and REST templates the CLI asks whether you want example CRUD scaffolding (Todo for Basic, User for REST).

What the CLI does:

- Creates the target folder (unless `.` is used).
- Copies the selected template folder from `backend/templates/<template>` into the target directory using the `copyTemplate` utility.
- Replaces occurrences of the placeholder `project-name` in template files with the selected project name.
- If the user declines example CRUD, the CLI runs `removeCrud` which deletes example files (models, controllers, routes, services, validations and schemas) and strips import/route blocks from `src/app.js` using the comment markers `// ROUTE_IMPORTS_START`/`// ROUTE_IMPORTS_END` and `// ROUTE_USES_START`/`// ROUTE_USES_END`.

After creation the CLI prints next steps: `cd <project>`, `npm install`, and `npm run dev` (or `npm start`).
