# CLI Commands

NeatNode provides an interactive CLI to scaffold Node.js projects. Here's how to use it.

---

## Main Command

```bash
npx neatnode
```

This launches the interactive project generator. No flags required — you'll be guided through prompts.

---

## Interactive Prompts

When you run the CLI, you'll be asked:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Project name** | Folder name for your new project |
| **Language** | JavaScript or TypeScript |
| **Template** | Basic, REST API, or Socket.IO |
| **Include CRUD?** | Whether to include example CRUD files |

---

## After Scaffolding

Once the CLI finishes, follow these steps:

```bash
cd <project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Global Installation

If you prefer running without `npx`:

```bash
npm install -g neatnode
neatnode
```

---

## Version Check

```bash
neatnode --version
```

Prints the currently installed CLI version.

---

## Help

```bash
neatnode --help
```

Displays available commands and options.
