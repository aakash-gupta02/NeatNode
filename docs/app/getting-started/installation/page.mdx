# Installation

NeatNode can be run directly with **npx** or installed globally as a CLI.

---

## Recommended (Run with npx)

No setup needed — always fetches the latest version.

```bash
npx neatnode
````

This automatically downloads and runs NeatNode without a global install.

> [!TIP]
> Use this method if you want the latest CLI updates every time.

---

## Global Installation (Optional)

Install the CLI once and run it anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g neatnode
```

Then simply run:

```bash
neatnode
```

> [!NOTE]
> Global install is useful for offline use or stable, locked versions.

---

## Verify Installation

Run the following command to confirm:

```bash
neatnode --version
```

You should see something like:

```
v1.0.0
```
