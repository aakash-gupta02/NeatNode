# Quickstart

Create a new project using the CLI:

```bash
npx neatnode
# follow prompts to choose project name and template
```

After scaffolding:

```bash
cd <project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Choose Basic for small services, REST API for a full backend, or Socket.IO for real-time apps.

# Quickstart

Create a new project in seconds:

```bash
npx neatnode create my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
````

This uses the interactive CLI to scaffold a project. Choose a template (Basic, REST API, or Socket.io) and follow the prompts.

Tips:
- Use the Basic template for tiny services.
- Use REST API for Express-based APIs with CRUD scaffolding.
- Use Socket.io for real-time examples.
