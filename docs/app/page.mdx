# Welcome to NeatNode Docs

NeatNode is a CLI tool that scaffolds **production-ready Node.js backends** in seconds — powered by clean, opinionated templates.

It eliminates repetitive setup work by giving you structured, extensible project blueprints for Express-based servers.

---

## Quick Start

Run the CLI directly with **npx** — no installation required:

```bash
npx neatnode
````

Follow the interactive prompts to:

* Enter a project name
* Choose a template (Basic, REST API, or Socket.IO)
* Decide whether to include example CRUD

Once done, NeatNode generates a complete backend that’s ready to run.
